This portfolio contains two coding projects written in Python. Both of these projects were completed in class settings and had specific instructions and guidelines. 
The first of them is a project that acts as a guessing game. The objective is for two players to enter the chore that must be completed and guess a number ranging from 1-10. The first player to correctly guess the number becomes exempt from completing the chore. This project used a fixed range of numbers, but the wage can be changed to use any numbers the players choose.
The second project is a budget planner that calculates the total of the user's bills and how much the user has to work to pay them. The user must enter the amount of their monthly bills. The code calculates how many hours the user has to work to pay their bills and keep $100 remaining for savings. This project used a fixed hourly wage, the wage variable can be changed to accept user input.
